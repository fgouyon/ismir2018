As in previous years, we will have a special “Unconference” in which participants break up into smaller groups to discuss Music-IR issues of particular interest.

This is an informal and informative opportunity to get to know peers and colleagues from around the world.

This year, the “Unconference” will last a whole evening, on Tuesday, September 25th at Télécom ParisTech.

The Unconference will take place at Télécom ParisTech.
