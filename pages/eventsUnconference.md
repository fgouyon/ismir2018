As in previous years, we will have a special “Unconference” in which participants break up into smaller groups to discuss Music-IR issues of particular interest.

This is an informal and informative opportunity to get to know peers and colleagues from around the world.

This year, the “Unconference” will last a whole evening, on Tuesday, September 25th. We will provide food and drinks during the whole evening.


## What is the Unconference ?

In the “Unconference”, participants team up into small groups to discuss MIR topics of their particular interest. This is an informal and informative opportunity to get to know peers and colleagues from around the world.

Each group is assigned a room for a 30 minutes discussion. After those 30 min, everyone go back to the main meeting room to propose/ select/ vote-for new discussion topics; or pursue the discussions on the same topic. The process is repeated during the whole evening.

## Reporting ?

Each discussion group will designate a person in charge of taking notes. These notes will be used to help summarizing the discussions for the "Unconference debriefing"”" held on Thursday 27th.

## Proposing discussion topics ?

In order to launch the process, we set up a [brainstorming page](https://dotstorming.com/b/5b9b86622a07d52717effa5c) were you can already start proposing discussion topics, comment them and vote for them.

The procedure to add a topic is to click on the “Add a card” button, on the right upper corner of the page and type what you want to submit. To vote, you should simply click on the little white circle at the bottom of the card.

You will of course be able to propose/ select/ vote-for other discussion topics during the whole Unconference evening, on the 25th.
