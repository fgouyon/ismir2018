## Overview

The 19th International Conference on Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR 2018) will be held in Paris, France, from September 23-27, 2018.

The annual conference of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) is the worldâ€™s leading research forum on processing, analyzing, searching, organizing and accessing music-related data. Music becomes music after being processed by the human mind and each person perceives the music in a different and complex way. Therefore, this conference embraces the complexity and diversity of music by showcasing ideas and applications that aim to enhance the way in which we interact with music.

Music Information Retrieval (MIR) is a truly interdisciplinary area, involving researchers, developers, educators, librarians, students and professionals from the disciplines of musicology, cognitive science, library and information science, computer science, electrical engineering and many others. Therefore, like previous ISMIR editions, ISMIR 2018 will provide a venue for the exchange of ideas, issues, results and perspectives among the different profiles of people working with music and computing in a broad sense. ISMIR 2018 will cover the entire area of MIR, providing ample room for diversity and new developments.
