The [ISMIR Society](http://ismir.net), [Women in MIR](http://www.ismir.net/wimir.html), and local organizers are offering a number of financial support opportunities for members of the community who wish to attend the 19th Conference of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR), September 23-27, 2018 in Paris, France
 
## Award Types

Eligible parties may apply for any or all of the following forms of support:

- Registration waivers for tutorials and scientific program (main conference)
- Lodging (note that students electing to use this housing may be required to share rooms due to high demand).

## Eligibility
Awards are granted based on the quality of the accepted submission, the degree of financial need, the applicant’s newness to ISMIR, and the applicant’s geographical diversity.

**Student Author Grants** are available for first or supporting authors of an accepted full paper who were students at the time of paper submission.

**Women in MIR (WiMIR)** Grants are being offered thanks to the generous support of industry partners to female first or supporting authors of accepted full papers as well as female first authors of accepted late-breaking demo (LBD) submissions. Applicants do NOT need to be students to apply for the WiMIR Award.
 
## Application Procedure
The application form for both awards can be found here: [https://goo.gl/forms/jyZ3iecMF2TdFRYX2](https://goo.gl/forms/jyZ3iecMF2TdFRYX2) 

Applicants will have the opportunity to indicate which award(s) they are eligible for. 

Those meeting eligibility criteria for both awards will be considered for both.
Applications close on **June 29, 2018**; notification of acceptance will be made on **July 1, 2018**.
 
## Important Notes

- If you have applied for a waiver to the tutorials and/or scientific program please do not register for the conference before being notified of your application’s status. Doing so will nullify your application. 

- Also note that to receive lodging coverage for the night of Thursday, September 27, you must be participating in either [DLfM 2018](https://dlfm.web.ox.ac.uk) or the [WiMIR 1st Annual Workshop](https://wimir.wordpress.com/2018/05/21/wimir-1st-annual-workshop/) on Friday, September 28. If you are not a confirmed participant at either workshop, you will lose your qualification for this night of lodging.
