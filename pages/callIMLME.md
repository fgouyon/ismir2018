The International Society for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) 2018 conference organisers are seeking submissions of creative work showcasing the use of machine learning and other MIR techniques in music composition and performance. This work can be of any musical genre. It will be exhibited as installations and/or interactive demos, and descriptions of each work will be published on the ISMIR’18 conference website.

## Format:

Your work should be presentable as an installation which can be experienced via headphones. You can supervise this at specified times during the conference or it can run unsupervised. You might propose live demo at specified times during the conference. We recommend that you also provide a poster or printed handout describing your work to attendees.

ISMIR can provide, if applicable:

- A table for a laptop or other equipment 
- An electrical outlet and extension cord 
- A nearby area to hang a poster 


You must provide all other equipment (e.g., computer, headphones). 

## What to submit:

Please submit a PDF document (no more than 4 pages) that will be reviewed by the conference committee. Please use CHI Extended Abstracts template [https://sigchi.org/templates/](https://sigchi.org/templates/)
This should include:

- The title of the work
- A 1-paragraph abstract describing your work, written for both ISMIR attendees and the general public, to be published on the ISMIR’18 website if applicable. The abstract should include high-level information about how ML or other MIR techniques are used in the work.
- Technical specifications, including space and equipment involved, and setup time required. (Note that ISMIR will not be able to provide equipment other than that listed above.)
- A description of how you will present the work at ISMIR (e.g., as an interactive demo, as a video, etc.)
- Any additional information about the work that you think will help the reviewers understand its implementation, assess its artistic merit, or envision how it will be of interest to ISMIR attendees.
- Links to online video and/or audio of the work (these may be on YouTube, SoundCloud, etc.)



## How to submit:

Please send the submission by email to [interactiveml.ismirexhibition@gmail.com](mailto:interactiveml.ismirexhibition@gmail.com)
