Women in MIR (WiMIR) is a group of people in the MIR community dedicated to promoting the role of, and increasing opportunities for, women in the field. We meet to network, share information, and discuss in an informal setting the goal of building a community that supports women – and more broadly, diversity – in the field of MIR.

WiMIR has held annual meetings at the ISMIR conference since 2012, garnering a high turnout of both female and male attendees. Since 2016, WiMIR has also organized a mentoring program connecting female students, postdocs, and early-stage researchers to more senior females and male allies in the field.

At this year's ISMIR, we will hold a WiMIR reception (date and time tba) and will also have a special WiMIR session at the conference. More details will be presented here soon.
