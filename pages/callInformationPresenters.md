As opposed to previous ISMIR editions, **all accepted papers will have BOTH AN ORAL AND A POSTER presentation**.

The reason for this is to favor the visibility (oral presentations) of all accepted papers while keeping a large space for discussions between authors and audience (poster presentations).

In order to achieve this, the duration of oral presentations will be reduced to 4' and will not have a question slot which is let for the poster part.

## Organization

Each day of the conference will have three sessions denoted by

- A, B for the first day, 
- C, D for the second day, 
- E, F for the third day.

Each session is made of 

- an oral presentation part
- a poster presentation part

Your paper will be assigned to one of the sessions A, B, C, D, E or F.
Which means that your oral and poster presentations will occur in the assigned session.

### Oral part

- During each oral presentation part, 18 papers will be presented.
- During your oral presentation part, you will have a **4' time-slot** to present your paper. 
- Papers will be presented one after the other without time for questions from the audience. 
- It is highly recommended that you **use the conference-computer** for your presentation and that you **upload** your presention to it before the session.

### Poster part

- The oral presentation part, is directly followed by the poster presentation part. 
- Authors of the 18 papers assigned to a session are **expected to be near their poster** during this session.
- Note that posters presented during one morning session, should be installed in the morning **before the opening of the first session** (before 8.30am); posters presented during one afternoon session, should be installed during noon **before the opening of the second session** (before 2.30pm). 
- All posters must use **portrait orientation** and be no larger than **ISO A0 size** or 36 x 48 inches. Posters can only be hung in Portrait format. There is no poster template.

### Example: 

My paper is assigned to session-E.

For the oral presentation: I also receive a position in the queue, 

For the poster session: I also receive a place number where to put my poster.

- I prepare my slides for my 4' oral presentation in session-E-oral.
- I also prepare a poster for session-E-poster.
- Since session-E is Tuesday 2018/09/26, I come early this day to install my poster before the opening of the conference.
- I also upload my slide presentation to the conference computer before session-E-oral starts.
- Before session-E-oral starts, I join the queue of all authors that will present their papers in session-E. 
- I do my 4' oral presentation.
- When session-E-oral ends, I join my poster to answer questions and discuss with the audience about my work.
