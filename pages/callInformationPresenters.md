As opposed to previous ISMIR editions, **all accepted papers will have BOTH AN ORAL AND A POSTER presentation**.

The reason for this is to favor the visibility (oral presentations) of all accepted papers while keeping a large space for discussions between authors and audience (poster presentations).

In order to achieve this, the duration of oral presentations will be reduced to 4' and will not have a question slot which is let for the poster part.

## Organization

Each day of the conference will have three sessions denoted by

- 1, 2, 3 for the first day, 
- 4, 5, 6 for the second day, 
- 7, 8, 9 for the third day.

Each session is made of 

- an oral presentation part
- a poster presentation part

Your paper will be assigned to one of the sessions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9.
Which means that your oral and poster presentations will occur in the assigned session.

### Oral part

- During each oral presentation part, 12 papers will be presented.
- During your oral presentation part, you will have a **4' time-slot** to present your paper. 
- Papers will be presented one after the other without time for questions from the audience. 
- It is highly recommended that you **use the conference-computer** for your presentation and that you **upload** your presention to it before the session.

### Poster part

- The oral presentation part, is directly followed by the poster presentation part. 
- Authors of the 12 papers assigned to a session are **expected to be near their poster** during this session.
- Note that all posters presented during one the three sessions of a given day, should be installed in the morning **before the opening of the first session** (before 8.30am). Posters will stay for the whole day.
- All posters must use **portrait orientation** and be no larger than **ISO A0 size** or 36 x 48 inches. Posters can only be hung in Portrait format. There is no poster template.
- Each of the three days, ends with a specific time slots (Posters 1+2+3, Posters 4+5+6 or Posters 7+8+9) which allows for even more discussion with the authors of the paper.

### Example: 

My paper is assigned to session-5.

For the oral presentation: I also receive a position in the queue, 

For the poster session: I also receive a place number where to put my poster.

- I prepare my slides for my 4' oral presentation in session-5-oral.
- I also prepare a poster for session-5-poster.
- Since session-5 is Tuesday 2018/09/25, I come early this day to install my poster before the opening of the conference.
- I also upload my slide presentation to the conference computer before session-5-oral starts.
- Before session-5-oral starts, I join the queue of all authors that will present their papers in session-5. 
- I do my 4' oral presentation.
- When session-5-oral ends, I join my poster to answer questions and discuss with the audience about my work.
- For the final session of the day (session 4+5+6) I'm free to decide wether I join my poster to answer questions or go to see the other posters.
