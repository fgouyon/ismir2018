### Your hosting is not near Cité Universitaire?
 
In case your hosting is not near Cité Universitaire, you can reach your place with the Paris Metro. Please check in the [map](http://metromap.fr/en) for the more convenient connexion.  Tickets for the Metro (and local buses) can be bought individually or in packs of ten (**un carnet**), which is cheaper. If you are staying in Paris for more than two days and you plan to visit the city then the carnet is an appealing option.
