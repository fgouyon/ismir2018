## Cit&eacute; Internationale Universitaire de Paris (CIUP)


The International University Campus in Paris is a private foundation, recognised as being in the public interest since 1925 and closely linked to the Paris universities, which own the buildings and  which are represented at its Management Board by the Rector of the Academy and Chancellor of the Universities of Paris, Acting Vice-President of the Foundation and the Presidents of two universities.

Ever since the Middle Ages the University of Paris has always welcomed students from all over the world. In what they used to call the “College of Nations”. When the international university campus in Paris was created in 1925 it continued this tradition of the Paris universities: a tradition of welcome. The International University Campus in Paris plays a central role in the policy for accepting internationally mobile students in the Ile-de-France.

## T&eacute;l&eacute;com ParisTech

T&eacute;l&eacute;com ParisTech is one of France's leading graduate engineering schools. It is located at 46 rue Barrault, in the 13th
arrondissement (zone) of Paris in a nice area called “La Butte aux Cailles”, which is often described as a
traditional village in Paris. The immediate neighborhood is rich of bars, restaurants, shops
and supermarkets, the closest ones being right in front of the school main entrance, that is no further than 1
minute walking distance away from the conference rooms.

Commuting to T&eacute;l&eacute;com ParisTech is very easy thanks to the dense network of public transportation in Paris and
the numerous metro and bus stations at walking distance (see map above).
