Paris is the capital and most populous city of France. Situated on the river Seine in the north of the country, it is
in the center of the Île-de-France region, also known as the r&eacute;gion parisienne, "Paris Region".
It is the home of the most visited art museum in the world, the Louvre, as well as the Mus&eacute;e d'Orsay, noted for
its collection of French Impressionist art, and the Mus&eacute;e National d'Art Moderne, a museum of modern and
contemporary art. The notable architectural landmarks of Paris include Notre Dame Cathedral (12th
century); the Sainte-Chapelle (13th century); the Eiffel Tower (1889); and the Basilica of Sacr&eacute;-Cœur on
Montmartre (1914). In 2014 Paris received 22.4 million visitors, making it one of the world's top tourist
destinations. Paris is also known for its fashion, particularly the twice-yearly Paris Fashion Week, and for its
haute cuisine, and three-star restaurants. Most of France's major universities and grandes &eacute;coles are located
in Paris
